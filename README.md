# Coding Bowl training bot

This bot serves the purpos of having an easy base for working together on one bot without having to much merge conflicts. Therefore it in designed in a way that modules can be simply added by inheriting from the ModuleBase class.


## Contributing

In order to contribute to this project you need to do the following steps:

1. Have python3, pip and git installed on your system
2. Create a working directory for this project
3. [Optional but recommended] Create a python venv in your wd and activate it
4. Install the dependencies
```
pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
```
5. Fork this repository and clone your fork
```
git clone <https://github.com/YOUR-FORK-ADDRESS.git>
```
6. Create a new branch for your feature
```
git checkout -b <ExampleFeatureBranchName>
```
7. Create a new module or make changes to the existing code base
8. Commit all changes
 ```
git add .
git commit -m "change description"
 ```
9. Merge new changes from master into your branch
```
git pull
git merge master
```
10. Push your feature
```
git push origin <ExampleFeatureBranchName>
```
11. Create a merge request from feature into master on github
12. Wait for approval

To be a bit faster, use `git commit -a -m "change description"` when no new files need to be added.

### Create a new module
To create a new module follow these steps:

1. Create a new .py in the modules folder
2. Import necessary libraries
```
from ModuleBase import ModuleBase
```
3. Create a new class in your .py and inherit from `ModuleBase`
```
class ModuleIndex(ModuleBase):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
```
4. Add funcionallity
5. Add the needed `getInformation()` function with this content
```
@staticmethod
    def getInformation() -> dict:
        """
        Some basic information for the module

        Returns:
            A dict with information on this module
        """
        return {
            "author": "<author>",
            "shortDesc": "<shortDesc>",
            "description": "<longDesc>",
            "commands": "command1  : <com1Desc>\n"
                        "command2  : <com2Desc>\n"
                        "command3  : <com3Desc>"
        }

```
If someone wants to wrap this in a class or has a better idea, a PR is much appreciated.

6. Add your module to config.json (True or False indicates wether a module gets leaded or not)
```
{
  "modules" :
    {
      "modules.<.pyName>" : <true/false>
    }
}
```

If your module uses other custom classes/files put them in a subfolder within the modules folder together with your .py
```
{
  "modules" :
    {
      "modules.<subfolder>.<.pyName>" : <true/false>
    }
}
```

For more information please refer to the `ModuleIndex` as an example.
## Testing

To test your module/bot you need to:

1. [Creat a discord server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-)
2. [Create a bot account and invite it to your server](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)
3. Create a .env file in the same folder where the botMain.py is and add the following line (replace <TOKEN> with your token)
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```
4. Start your bot with:
```
cd bowlBot
python bowlMain.py
```

For the sake of testing you can give your bot admin rights and activate all intents.
## Documentation

For now there will be no documentation for this bot. So please add the getInformation() method to your module and add docstrings.
For an example please refer to `bowlBot/modules/ModuleIndex.py.
